## Compilation and usage

### Compilation

To compile: type the following in the directory containing this README.

> javac -d bin .\src\slp\util\*.java .\src\slp\text_slp\*.java .\src\slp\lz77_slp\gzip_parser\*.java .\src\slp\lz77_slp\*.java .\src\slp\Main.java

To run: type the following in `bin`

> java slp.Main

###Usage
**Main menu**
Run the program will display the main menu providing 3 options:

1. Compress text into SLP
2. Convert LZ77 to SLP
3. Convert SLP to LZ77

**Compress text into SLP**
On input '1', the user is prompted to choose the offline or online version of the compression algorithm.

**Offline**

1. text to cfg
   compress the input text file into a slp(cfg), result will be saved as a '.cfg' file.
2. _cfg to grammar tree_
   visualise the '.cfg' file as a parse tree, printed in terminal.
3. _cfg to text_
   decompress the '.cfg' into text, result will be saved as a new file with suffix '(1)'.

**Online**

1. text to succinct grammar
   compress the input text file into a compact grammar, result will be saved as a '.slp' file.
2. text to cfg
   compress the input text file into a slp(cfg), result will be saved as a '.cfg' file.
3. cfg to succinct grammar
   Convert the input '.cfg' file into '.slp' file.
4. cfg to grammar tree
   visualise the '.cfg' file as a parse tree, printed in terminal.
5. succinct grammar to text
   decompress the '.slp' file into text, result will be saved as a new file with suffix '(1)'.
6. cfg to text
   decompress the '.cfg' into text, result will be saved as a new file with suffix '(1)'.

**Convert LZ77 to SLP**
convert a GZIP compressed ('.gz') file into a SLP('.cfg') file.

**Convert SLP to LZ77**

1. slp to lz77
   convert the input '.cfg' file into a LZ77 factorization('.lz77')
2. decompress lz77
   decompress a LZ77 factorization('.lz77' file) into text, saved as a new file with suffix '(1)'.

### Test

Test data can be found in `test` directory.
