## Algorithms for compressed text
### Tianlong Zhong 

Efficient compression algorithms and transformations between SLP and LZ77 representations.

Software that would implement the following algorithms:

(1) transform input text into an SLP representation that's not too big compared to the smallest grammar for this text, following the paper

    Artur Jez: A really simple approximation of smallest grammar. Theor. Comput. Sci. 616: 141-150 (2016)

(2) transform an input SLP into an LZ77 representation (in an appropriate standard file format),

(3) transform an input LZ77 representation into SLP.

The main deliverable for the project is the software (library/tool). This
should come with documentation and appropriate test suite. Ideally, you
could release your software under an open source or free software license.

For items (2) and (3), you should use Lohrey's 2012 survey as the source
of references. I would of course be happy to help you read and understand
the relevant papers during the year. Also for items (2) and (3), you can
benefit from and build on previous works on the subject, such as
partial implementations in the projects that my project students have
worked on in the previous years (I'll share the links with you) as well
as other software you may find online.
